This directory contains the erlang source modules for an implementation
of the ITU-T version of the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP).
See ITU-T recommendations Q.711-Q.715 for the specification this
implementation is derived from.

The basic structure of the SCCP appears in Figure 1/Q.714 - SCCP overview.
It is divided into four functional blocks (ref: Q.714 clause 1.4):

	SCCP connection-oriented control (SCOC)
	SCCP connectionless control (SCLC)
	SCCP management (SCMG)
	SCCP routing control (SCRC)
